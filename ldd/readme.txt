                    ldd - final version - tsconf + vdac demo

  yet another demo from b-state in 0x7e0 - we are alive! (at least me :)

  contribution to zx enhanced compo 2o16 held in...somewhere in ukraine :))

  it was done in less than four days because I was nearly pissed off by some
  people but netherless I did it (thought it was smashed together in last two
  hours before the deadline and suddenly it worked ;)
 
    >>z80 + 4mb ram + tsconf + vdac + ay\ym + eyes + ears + drink required<<
 
  5000w loudspeakers + good monitor recommended

  special greets goes to hacker vbi and ts-labs for great party - keep rockin'!
  also "hi!" to breeze\fishbone, g0blinish and others who supported me.

  FUCKINGS goes to AAA and fucking govnoforum (aka zx-pk.ru) users who really
  think that this demo is a pure animation and "colorcycling". FUCK YOU!

  SUPER-DUPER-MEGA FUCKINGS TO LVD for fake release - DIE, FUCKING MORON!

  see ya @ CSP and CC'2o16!
